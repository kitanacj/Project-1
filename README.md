# Project 1
 
Created a webpage based off the BRATZ Dollz
The home page is kinda like a lobby space where the theme song places and you get the general sense of theme and color palette
There is the page MEET THE BRATZ, where users can see the four main BRATZ
There is the page CLOSET INSPO, where there are links to youtube videos of people trying the 2000s trends inspired by the BRATZ iconic fashion 
Lastly the MOVIE page, where there are movie posters and a link to a found youtube movie playlist for users to rewatch or watch for the first time BRATZ
